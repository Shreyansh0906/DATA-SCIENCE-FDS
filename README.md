# DATA-SCIENCE-FDS
Part 1: Vector Clocks and Causal Consistency
Objective Implement a key-value store across 3 nodes that maintains causal consistency using vector clocks. The system should detect out-of-order messages and delay their processing until causal dependencies are satisfied.
Part 2 :Dynamic Load Balancing for a Smart Grid
Objective
To design and build a scalable system for a Smart Grid that dynamically balances Electric
Vehicle (EV) charging requests across multiple substations based on their real-time load,
complete with a comprehensive observability stack
